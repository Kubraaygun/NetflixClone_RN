# Netflix Clone

This project I have prepared is a Netflix Clone application developed with React Native. Users can discover popular movies, view detailed movies and have a dynamic content experience.

## Project Purpose

The main goal of the project is to use Redux Toolkit in a practical way and make data management more efficient. This facilitates data sharing between different parts of the application. Data such as movies, categories, popular and upcoming movies are managed centrally with Redux.

## Project Features:

- **Home Screen:** You can view popular movies and trends.
- **Movie Detail Screen:** Provides more information and visuals about the selected movie.
- **Categories:** Provides easier discovery by categorizing movies.
- **Responsive Design:** Flexible design compatible with different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used:

- **React Native:** The basic infrastructure of the mobile application.
- **Redux Toolkit and React-Redux:** Powerful and easy-to-use Redux tools for managing application state.
- **Formik and Yup:** Form management and validation.
- **Axios:** Data retrieval with API integration.
- **TMDB API:** Retrieves movie data in real time and presents it to the user.
