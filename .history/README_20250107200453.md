# Netflix Clone

This project I have prepared is a Netflix Clone application developed with React Native. Users can discover popular movies, view detailed movies and have a dynamic content experience.

## Project Purpose

The main goal of the project is to use Redux Toolkit in a practical way and make data management more efficient. This facilitates data sharing between different parts of the application. Data such as movies, categories, popular and upcoming movies are managed centrally with Redux.
